# Fresh-Eyes
A command line tool that will go through your ruby program and narrate what is happening, much like a teammate seeing your application for the first time would, then run the program and, if any error occurs, will curl a stack overflow article relating to the error to your prompt for quick viewing.

# Goals  
Create a tool that helps eliminate the gridlock phase of development (something is broken and all you need is a second pair of fresh eyes to take a glance at your code)  
Get immediate help from stack overflow so you never have to leave the command line (there is no place like ~~home~~ the command line)  


# Features
Ruby specific lexer so narrate what is happening in your program  
Error reported that hits the stack overflow api for program-specific errors 
Easy to use user interface so that users can use it quickly and often  

# Sound Cool?
Shout out some suggestions or features, I'm all ears. Or help me work on it, that's always fun too.
